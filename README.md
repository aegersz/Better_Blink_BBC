[color=red][size=18pt]Better Blink BBCode[/size][/color][hr]

With this mod, you can blink text in posts on your forum.

Usage: [nobbc][blink]Text[/blink][/nobbc]

Check to see if you have any other older blink BBC mods on first
as they may need uninstalling or disabling.

Note: the "blink.gif" button image is borrowed from the defunct blinkbbc_1-0 mod 
and is renamed to "blink.png" for SMF 2.1 compatability.
